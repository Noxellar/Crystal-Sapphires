# Neon Midnight

~~Crystal Sapphires is a VS Code theme that I created for myself, made with the help of [Yeoman's VS Code Extension Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-code). Install it it you want but this was designed for my own taste since I couldn't fine the right theme for me (by that I mean I looked through the most popular ones and then gave up).

Also, programming is a hobby for me, not a profession so I don't really know that much. I really only tested this out for Python, HTML, CSS, and JS; like I said, made for me.~~

Neon Midnight is the new, revamped version of my previous theme Crystal Sapphires. A new, regenerated version of the previous theme, there are more, brighter syntax colours which provide much more visibility than before. Made from [Yeoman's VS Code Extension Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-code), this supports syntax highlighting for multiple languages. This is still a WORK IN PROGRESS and is still under development for those weird additional scopes for Markup/down and still needs original colours for JSON.

BTW I still need to update the icon ...

## Conclusion

This is still a WIP but has improved a lot. Get it if you want but w/e you just found this by accident it's only on the store because I'm way too optimistic that this will take off anytime soon ...

# Neon Midnight

Neon Midnight is the new, revamped version of my previous theme Crystal Sapphires. A new, regenerated version of the previous theme, there are more, brighter syntax colours which provide much more visibility than before. Made from [Yeoman's VS Code Extension Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-code), this supports syntax highlighting for multiple languages. This is still a WORK IN PROGRESS and is still under development.

BTW I still need to update the icon ...

## Conclusion

This is still a WIP but has improved a lot. Get it if you want but w/e you just found this by accident it's only on the store because I'm way too optimistic that this will take off anytime soon ...
